# TSL Test

PCB and firmware for the CW&T Time Since Lanuch project.

## Design goal:

Run for decades on 2xAA batteries. 

## Critical parts:

* ATMEGA169P processor for LCD driving and supervision
* DS3231S for precision timekeeping
* 2x  AIExpress 6-digit, 7-segment dynamic LCD glass 
* 2x Energizer Ultimate Lithium AA batteries

## Interesting twists

We actuallyt have two oscilaros 
The ATMEGA169A 

## Status

We are at an average of 10uA running current over the full voltage range. 

If the battery datasheets are to be believed, this suggests a runtime of 10-20 years.
