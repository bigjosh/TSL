// The SETUP macro loads all of the registers with the 
// with some values that make it faster to update the LCD 
// It is defined as a macro because we need to run it both
// on normal entry to update_lcd_1_hour but also on entry
// on entry to update_lcd_1_hour_start_at. We could make it
// a subrotine but then we would have the overhead of call/ret
// everytime it runs (once per hour) for the entire life of the product.
// Since we have plenty of flash, a macro works well becuase we 
// can just repeat teh code whereever we need it. 
// This macro does push stuff to the stack
// This macro does not touch Z (r31:r30)
